# Sudoku Solver

Solves a 9 by 9 Sudoku using the backtrack algorithm. I also utilize the PennDraw class to draw the Sudoku puzzle as it is being solved and the In class
to read input text files containing the Sudoku puzzle to be solved. 

## Input File Formatting

The input file contains 9 lines of 9 digit integers. Squares to be filled in are indicated by 0s. Below is an example of an input file.
